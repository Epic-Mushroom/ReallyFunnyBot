got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
side side to side
This task a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds
Tonight night night
Diamonds tonight
Heads up
You hear a sound turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh no it's you again
I can never forget those eyes eyes eyes
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again
And run run until it's done done
Until the sun comes up in the morn
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
Just when you think you're safe
Overhear some hissing from right behind
Right right behind
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's gotta end at this time time time
Time time time time
Blows up then your health bar drops
And you could use a 1-up
Get inside don't be tardy
So now you're stuck in there
Half a heart is left but don't die die die
Die die die
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again
Bolt again-gain
And run run until it's done done
Until the sun comes up in the morn
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight

And craft those diamonds
And make some armor

Go and forge that like you so MLG pro
The sword's made of diamonds

Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight
Every single day and the whole night
Creeper's out prowlin alright
Look at me look at you
Take my revenge that's what I'm gonna do
I'm a warrior baby what else is new
And my blade's gonna tear through you
